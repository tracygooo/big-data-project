1. For the calculation of XT*X, we only need to compute the elements of upper triangle, because of its symmetry
2. Construct training and testing scripts seperately
	obtain weights (beta) from training scripts
	use weights calculated from training as input, test_mapper.py will calculate individual Xi * beta
	test_reducer.py will get metrics ()
